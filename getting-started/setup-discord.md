# Setup Discord

Create a new application and bot. After creating the bot you will be able to get your token and add it to the `.env` file:

### Authorization

We need to assign our new bot to a server. You can register the new bot with your server by opening a browser and going to:  
  
[https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=CLIENT\_ID\_GOES\_HERE&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot)

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace CLIENT\_ID\_GOES\_HERE with your Client Id from the step above!
{% endhint %}
