# Setup .env

  
In the root directory of our project we need to have a plain text file that contains variables for configuring our application.  
  
We'll use the default `.env` filename so that when we call `dotenv.config()` before our app starts it will make these variables available as "environment variables" under the `process.env` object.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title=".env" %}
```typescript
TOKEN=<your discord bot token>
OWNER_ID=<your discord user id>

MYSQL_HOST=<mysql hostname>
MYSQL_PORT=<mysql port>
MYSQL_USER=<mysql username>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql password>
MYSQL_DATABASE=<mysql database

#
# Optional - If helpbot is installed
#
HELPBOT_COMMAND_PREFIX=?
HELPBOT_ADMIN_ROLE_NAME=<name of the role with super user permissions>
HELPBOT_QUESTIONS_CHANNEL_ID=<discord channel id to send helpbot questions to>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you add "**.env**" to your .gitignore file to prevent your token and other credentials from being exposed in your git repository remote\(s\).
{% endhint %}
