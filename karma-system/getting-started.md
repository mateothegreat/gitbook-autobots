Let's create a karma tracking system which will log points for users when they send a message like `thanks @mateothegreat` or `thank you @mateothegreat and @autobot`.

To do so we will need to create a database entity and two commands. One command will handle all messages and will parse out user id's and the other will display a leaderboard.
